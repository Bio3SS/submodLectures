Fresh install
* Clone
* make makestuff.msync
* make pullup
* make rmsync is good if things are out-of-date, but chokes (can't commit) if they're not
	* make rmaster seems like a good substitute
* make all.time then gets most of the way

######################################################################

* make rum (makestuff seems to make itself on the way)
* make local.mk (I use `make jd.lmk`)
* make rup required a ton of makestuff syncs
	* use something else first
	* figure out why!

Thoughts:
* maybe rebuild all of these tools. Not trusting the git versions... but can that be the reason?
