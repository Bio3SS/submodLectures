Fresh install
* Clone
* make rum (makestuff seems to make itself on the way)
* make local.mk (I use `make jd.lmk`)
* make rup required a ton of makestuff syncs
	* use something else first
	* figure out why!

Thoughts:
* maybe rebuild all of these tools. Not trusting the git versions... but can that be the reason?
