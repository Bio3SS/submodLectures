UNIT 4: Structured populations

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Introduction

	Up until now we've tracked populations with a single state variable
	(population size or population density)

	NEWPOLL  What assumption are we making?

		ANS All individuals can be counted the same.  

			ANS Always (continuous time) 

			ANS At census time (discrete time)

	What are some organisms for which this seems like a good
	approximation?

		ANS Dandelions, bacteria, insects

	What are some organisms that don't work so well?

		ANS Trees, people, codfish

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Structured populations

	If we think age or size is important to understanding a population,
	we might model it as an {\bf structured} population

	Instead of just keeping track of the total number of individuals
	in our population \ldots

		Keeping track of how many individuals of each age

			or size

			or developmental stage

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Example: biennial dandelions

	Imagine a population of dandelions

		Adults produce 80 seeds each year

		1% of seeds survive to become adults

		50% of first-year adults survive to reproduce again

		Second-year adults never survive

	Will this population increase or decrease through time?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How to study this population

	Choose a census time

		Before reproduction or after

		Since we have complete cycle information, either one should work

	Figure out how to predict the population at the next census

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Census choices

BC

	Before reproduction

		All individuals are adults

		We want to know how many adults we will see next year

	After reproduction

		Seeds, one-year-olds and two-year-olds

		Two-year-olds have already produced their seeds; once these seeds
		are counted, the two-year-olds can be ignored, since they will
		not reproduce or survive again

RSLIDE Example: biennial dandelions

	Imagine a population of dandelions

		Adults produce 80 seeds each year

		1% of seeds survive to become adults

		50% of first-year adults survive to reproduce again

		Second-year adults never survive

	Will this population increase or decrease through time?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What determines $\lambda$?

	If we have 20 adults before reproduction, how many do we expect to
	see next time?

	$\lambda = p + f$ is the total number of individuals per individual
	after one time step

	NEWPOLL  What is $f$ in this example? |  What is the fecundity in this example?

		ANS 0.8

	NEWPOLL  What is $p$ in this example? |  What is the survival probability in this example?

		ANS 0.5 for 1-year-olds and 0 for 2-year-olds.

		ANS We can't take an average, because we don't know the
		population structure

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What determines $\R$?

	$\R$ is the average total number of offspring produced by an
	individual over their lifespan

	Can start at any stage, but need to close the loop

	NEWPOLL  What is the reproductive number?

	ANS If you become an adult you produce (on average)

		ANS 0.8 adults your first year

		ANS 0.4 adults your second year

	ANS $\R=1.2$

CHANGE CC: Explaining how to calculate R on the board was helpful I think but probably go a little slower

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What does \R\ tell us about $\lambda$?

	ANS Population increases when $\R>1$, so $\lambda>1$ exactly
	when  $\R>1$

	If $\R=1.2$, then $\lambda$

		ANS $>1$ -- the population is increasing

		ANS $<1.2$ -- the life cycle takes more than 1 year, so it should
		take more than one year for the population to increase 1.2 times

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Modeling approach

BC

	In this unit, we will construct \emph{simple} models of structured
	populations

		To explore how structure might affect population dynamics

		To investigate how to interpret structured data

Regulation

	\emph{Simple} population models with regulation can have extremely
	complicated dynamics

	\emph{Structured} population models with regulation can have
	insanely complicated dynamics

	Here we will focus on understanding structured population models
	\emph{without regulation}:

		ANS Individuals behave independently, or (equivalently)

		ANS Average per capita rates do not depend on population size

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CSLIDE Complexity

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Age-structured models

BC

	The most common approach is to structure by age

	In age-structured models we model how many individuals there are in
	each ``age class''

		Typically, we use age classes of one year

		Example: salmon live in the ocean for roughly a fixed number of
		years; if we know how old a salmon is, that strongly affects how
		likely it is to reproduce

NC

SIDEFIG webpix/salmon.jpg

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stage-structured models

BC

	In stage-structured models, we model how many individuals there are
	in different stages

		Ie., newborns, juveniles, adults

		More flexible than an age-structured model

		Example: forest trees may survive on very little light for a long
		time before they have the opportunity to recruit to the sapling
		stage

NC

SIDEFIG webpix/tongass.jpg

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Discrete vs.\ continuous time

	Structured models can be done in either discrete or continuous time

	Continuous-time models are structurally simpler (and smoother)

	NEWPOLL  How do population characteristics affect the choice? | When might we prefer a continuous-time model?

		ANS Populations with continuous reproduction (e.g. bacteria), may be
		better suited to continuous-time models

		ANS Populations with \textbf{synchronous} reproduction (e.g., moths) may
		be better suited to discrete-time models

	Adding age structure is conceptually simpler with discrete time

		ANS So we'll do that.

	CHANGE Extra polls here, incorporate with a command

	CHANGE When might we prefer a continuous-time model?

	CHANGE When might we prefer a discrete-time model? (maybe not bother)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Constructing a model

	This section will focus on \textbf{linear, discrete-time,
	age-structured} models

	State variables: how many individuals of each age at any given time

	Parameters: $p$ and $f$ \emph{for each age that we are modeling}

CHANGE CC: Helpful to draw the table of what is happening to each age-class next year but probably a little slower for the explanations

----------------------------------------------------------------------

When to count

	We will choose a census time that is appropriate for our
	study

		Before reproduction, to have the fewest number of individuals

		After reproduction, to have the most information about the
		population processes

		Some other time, for convenience in counting

			ANS A time when individuals gather together

			ANS A time when they are easy to find (insect pupae)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The conceptual model

	Once we choose a census time, we imagine we know the population for
	each age $x$ after time step $T$.

		We call these values $N_x(T)$

	Now we want to calculate the expected number of individuals in each
	age class at the next time step

		We call these values $N_x(T+1)$

	NEWPOLL  What do we need to know? | What do we need to know to calculate population for next time?

		ANS The survival probability of each age group: $p_x$

		ANS The average fecundity of each age group: $f_x$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Closing the loop

	$f_x$ and $p_x$ must close the loop back to the census time, so we
	can use them to simulate our model:

		$f_x$ has units [new indiv (at census time)]/[age $x$ indiv
		(at census time)]

		$p_x$ has units [age $x+1$ indiv (at census time)]/[age $x$ indiv
		(at census time)]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The structured model

WIDEFIG my_images/structure_cc.png

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SS Model dynamics

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Short-term dynamics

	This model's short-term dynamics will depend on parameters
	\ldots

		It is more likely to go up if fecundities and survival
		probabilities are high

	\ldots and starting conditions

		If we start with mostly very old or very young individuals, it
		might go down; with lots of reproductive adults it might go up

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-term dynamics

	If a population follows a model like this, it will tend to reach

		a \textbf{stable age distribution}:

			the \emph{proportion} of individuals in each age class is
			constant

		a stable value of $\lambda$

			if the proportions are constant, then we can average over
			$f_x$ and $p_x$, and the system will behave like our simple
			model

	NEWPOLL  What are the long-term dynamics of such a system?

		ANS Exponential growth or exponential decline

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exception

	Populations with \textbf{independent cohorts} do not tend to reach a
	stable age distribution

		A \textbf{cohort} is a group that enters the population at the
		same time

		We say my cohort and your cohort interact if my children
		might be in the same cohort as your children

		or my grandchildren might be in the same cohort as your
		great-grandchlidren

		\ldots

	As long as all cohorts interact (none are independent), then the
	unregulated model leads to a stable age distribution (SAD)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Independent cohorts

	Some populations might have independent cohorts:

		If salmon reproduce \emph{exactly} every four years, then:

			the 2015 cohort would have offspring in 2019, 2023, 2027,
			2031, \ldots

			the 2016 cohort would have offspring in 2020, 2024, 2028,
			2032, \ldots

			in theory, they could remain independent -- distribution would
			not converge

	Examples could include 17-year locusts, century plants, \ldots

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Life tables

	People often study structured models using \textbf{life tables}

	A life table is made \emph{from the perspective of a particular
	census time}

	It contains the information necessary to project to the next census:

		How many survivors do we expect at the next census for each
		individual we see at this census? ($p_x$ in our model)

		How many offspring do we expect at the next census for each
		individual we see at this census? ($f_x$ in our model)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cumulative survivorship

	The first key to understanding how much each organism will
	contribute to the population is {\bf survivorship}

	In the field, we estimate the probability of survival from age $x$
	to age $x+1$: $p_x$

		This is the probability you will be \emph{counted} at age $x+1$,
		given that you were \emph{counted} at age $x$.

	To understand how individuals contribute to the population, we are
	also interested in the overall probability that individuals survive
	to age $x$: $\ell_x$.

		ANS $\ell_x = p_1 \times \ldots p_{x-1}$

		ANS $\ell_x$ measures the probability that an
		individual survives to be counted at age $x$, given that it is
		ever counted at all (ie., it survives to its first census)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating \R

	We calculate \R\ by figuring out the estimated contribution at each
	age group, \emph{per individual who was ever counted}

		We figure out expected contribution given you were ever counted by
		multiplying:

		ANS $f_x \times \ell_x$

SS Calculation details

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFHEAD $f_x$ vs.~$m_x$

	Here we focus on $f_x$ -- the number of offspring seen at the
	next census (next year) per organism of age $x$ seen at this census

	An alternative perspective is $m_x$: the total number of offspring
	per reproducing individual of age $x$

	NEWPOLL  How would I calculate one from the other? 

		ANS To get $f_x$ we multiply $m_x$ by one or more survival terms,
		depending on when the census is

		ANS $f_x$ needs to close the loop from one census to the next

----------------------------------------------------------------------

When do we start counting?

	Is the first age class called 0, or 1?

		In this course, we will start from age class 1

		If we count right {\em after} reproduction, this means we are
		calling newborns age class 1.  Don't get confused.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating \R

	The reproductive number \R\ gives the average lifetime reproduction
	of an individual, and is a valuable summary of the information in
	the life table 

		$\R = \sum_x{\ell_x f_x}$

		If $\R>1$ in the long (or medium) term, the population will
		increase 

		If $\R$ is persistently $<1$, the population is in trouble

	We can ask (for example):

		Which ages have a large \emph{contribution} to \R?

		NEWPOLL  Which values of $p_x$ and $f_x$ is \R\ sensitive to? | Which values of p_x and f_x is R sensitive to?

			ANS The $p$s for young individuals affect all the $\ell$s.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The effect of old individuals

	Estimating the effects of old individuals on a population can be
	difficult, because both $f$ and $\ell$ can be extreme

		The contribution of an age class to $\R$ is $\ell_x f_x$

		NEWPOLL  Extreme how? |  How are these values extreme?

		ANS In most populations $\ell$ can be very small for large $x$

		ANS In many populations, $f$ can be very large for large $x$

	Reproductive potential of old individuals \emph{may} or \emph{may
	not} be important

		ANS In many tree populations, most individuals don't survive to get huge,
		but the huge trees may have most of the total reproduction

		ANS In many bird populations, old birds produce fairly well, but not
		nearly enough to outweigh the low probability of being old.

TSS Measuring growth rates

	In a constant population, each age class replaces itself:

		$\R = \sum_x \ell_x f_x = 1$

	In an exponentially changing population, each year's {\bf cohort} is
	a factor of $\lambda$ bigger (or smaller) than the previous one

		$\lambda$ is the finite rate of increase, like before

	Looking back in time, the cohort $x$ years ago is $\lambda^{-x}$ as
	large as the current one

	The existing cohorts need to make the next one:

		$\sum_x \ell_x f_x \lambda^{-x} = 1$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Euler equation

	If the life table doesn't change, then $\lambda$ is given by $\sum_x
	\ell_x f_x \lambda^{-x} = 1$

	We basically ask, if the population has the structure we would
	expect from growing at rate $\lambda$, would it continue to grow at
	rate $\lambda$.

	On the left-side each cohort started as $\lambda$ times smaller than the
	one after it

		Then got multiplied by $\ell_x$.

	Under this assumption, is the next generation $\lambda$ times bigger
	again?

	Example from spreadsheet

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFHEAD $\lambda$ and \R

	If the life table doesn't change, then $\lambda$ is given by $\sum_x
	\ell_x f_x \lambda^{-x} = 1$

		What's the relationship between $\lambda$ and \R?

	When $\lambda=1$, the left hand side is just \R.

		If $\R>1$, the population more than replaces itself when
		$\lambda=1$.  We must make $\lambda>1$ to decrease LHS and
		balance.

		If $\R<1$, the population fails to replace itself when
		$\lambda=1$.  We must make $\lambda<1$ to increase LHS and
		balance.

	So \R\ and $\lambda$ tell the same story about whether the population
	is increasing

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Time scales

	$\lambda$ gives the number of individuals per individual \emph{every
	year}

	$\R$ gives the number of individuals per individual \emph{over a
	lifetime}

	NEWPOLL  What relationship do we expect for an annual population (individuals die every year)? |  What relationship do we expect for an annual population? R>lam; R<lam; R=lam; R between lam and 1; lam between R and 1.

		ANS $\R=\lambda$; each organism observed reproduces \R\ offspring
		on average, all in one time step

	NEWPOLL  For a long-lived population? |  What relationship do we expect for a long-lived population? R>lam; R<lam; R=lam; R between lam and 1; lam between R and 1.

		ANS The \R\ offspring are produced slowly, so population changes
		slowly

			ANS $\lambda$ should be closer to 1 than \R\ is.

			ANS But on the same side (same answer about whether population
			is growing)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Studying population growth

	$\lambda$ and \R\ give similar information about your population

	\R\ is easier to calculate, and more generally useful

	But $\lambda$ gives the actual rate of growth

		More useful in cases where we expect the life table to be
		constant with exponential growth or decline for a long time

  CHANGE MK: In tutorial I showed how lambda changes per generation as the age distribution is approaching its stable distribution, which seemed to help students. Maybe include a quick calculation?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth and decline

	If we think a particular period of growth or decline is important,
	we might want to study how factors affect $\lambda$

		Complicated, but well-developed, theory

		In a growing population, what happens early in life is more
		important to $\lambda$ than to \R.

		In a declining population, what happens late in life is more
		important to $\lambda$ than to \R.

	Which is likely to be more important to ecology and evolution?

		ANS The two phases (growth and decline) will be roughly balanced

		ANS Because otherwise the population would go to zero or infinity

SS Survivorship

Patterns of survivorship

	NEWPOLL  What sort of patterns do you expect to see in $p_x$? | What sort of patterns do you expect to see in survival probabilities?

		ANS Younger individuals usually have lower survivorship

		ANS Older individuals often have lower survivorship

	What about $\ell_x$?

		ANS It goes down

		ANS But sometimes faster and sometimes slower

		ANS Best understood on a log scale

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Recall: we always start from age \emph{class} 1

		If we count newborns, we still call them class 1.  

	NEWPOLL  What is $\ell_1$ when we count before reproduction? |  What is l_1 when we count before reproduction?

		ANS 1

		ANS $\ell_1$ is the probability you're counted at age class 1,

TSS Fecundity

	Just as in our simple population growth models, we define fecundity
	as the expected number of offspring at the next census produced by
	an individual observed at this census

		Parent must survive from counting to reproduction

		Parent must give birth

		Offspring must survive from birth to counting

	Remember to think clearly about gender when necessary

		Are we tracking females, or everyone?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fecundity patterns

	$f_x$ is the average number of new individuals \emph{counted} next
	census per individual in age class $x$ \emph{counted} this census

	Fecundity often goes up early in life and then remains constant

		ANS Most birds, many large mammals

	It may also go up and then come down

		ANS people

	It may also go up and up as organisms get older

		ANS Many fish, many trees

Learning from the model

	If a population has constant size (ie., the same number of
	individuals are born every year), what determines the proportion of
	individuals in each age class?

		ANS Distribution should be proportional to $\ell_x$

	What if population is growing?

		ANS We expect proportionally more individuals in younger age
		classes

			ANS Number of births in more recent cohorts is larger

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stable age distribution

	If a population has reached a SAD, and is increasing at rate
	$\lambda$ (given by the Euler equation):

		the $x$ year old cohort, born $x$ years ago originally had a
		size $\lambda^{-x}$ relative to the current one

		a proportion $\ell_x$ of this cohort has survived

		thus, the relative size of cohort $x$ is $\lambda^{-x} \ell_x$

		SAD depends only on survival distribution $\ell_x$ and $\lambda$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Patterns

	Populations tend to be bottom-heavy (more individuals at lower age
	classes)

		Many individuals born, few survive to older age classes

	If population is growing, this increases the lower classes further

		More individuals born more recently

	If population is \emph{declining}, this shifts the age
	distribution in the opposite direction 

		Results can be complicated

		Declining populations may be bottom-heavy, top-heavy or just
		jumbled

----------------------------------------------------------------------

University cohorts

	McMaster accepts only first-year students.  For any given stage
	(e.g., end of third year) the same proportion drop out each year

	What can you say about the relative size of the classes if:

		The same number of students is admitted each year?

			ANS The lower classes are larger

		NEWPOLL  More students are admitted each year? |  If more students are admitted each year, lower classes will be: larger, smaller, it depends.

			ANS The lower classes are larger (even more so)

		NEWPOLL  Fewer students are admitted each year? |  If fewer students are admitted each year, lower classes will be: larger, smaller, it depends.

			ANS Anything could happen (drop outs and size change are
			operating in different directions)

Forest size classes

	When we go to an apparently stable forest ecosystem, it seems to be
	dominated by large trees, not small ones.  What up?

	NEWPOLL  How is it possible that these systems are dominated by large trees?

		ANS Large trees are larger

		ANS Population may be declining

		ANS Trees may spend longer in some size classes than in others

		ANS Life table may not be constant (smaller trees may recruit at
		certain times and places)

----------------------------------------------------------------------


TSS Stage structure

	Stage structure works just like age structure, except that what
	stage you are in is not strictly predicted by how old you are

		Age-structured models need fecundity, and survival probability

		ANS In stage-structured models survival is typically broken into:

			ANS Survival into same stage

			ANS Survival with recruitment (ie., to the next larger class
			of individuals)

		More complicated models are also possible

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Advantages

	Stage structured models don't need a maximum age

	Nor one box for every single age class

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unregulated growth

	What happens if you have a constant stage table (no regulation)?

		Fecundity, and survival and recruitment probabilities are constant

	Similar to constant life table

		Can calculate \R\ and $\lambda$ (will be consistent with each
		other)

		Can calculate a stable stage distribution

		COMMENT \R\ is about the same as in age structured model

	Unregulated growth cannot persist

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary

	If the life table remains constant (no regulation or stochasticity):

		Reach a stable age (or stage) distribution

		Grow or decline with a constant $\lambda$

		Factors behind age distribution can be understood

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Regulated growth

	Our models up until now have assumed that individuals are independent

	In this case, we expect populations to grow (or decline)
	exponentially

	We do not expect that the long-term average value of \R\ or
	$\lambda$ will be exactly 1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The value of simple models

	There is a lot of mathematical study of unregulated, age-structured
	populations, but it should be taken with a grain of salt

		ANS We know that real populations are regulated

		ANS Populations can't increase or decrease exponentially for very
		long

	Understanding this behaviour is helpful:

		interpreting age structures in real populations

		beginning to understand more complicated systems

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation and structure

	We expect real populations to be regulated

	The long-term average value of $\lambda$ under regulation
	\emph{could} be exactly 1

	There is also likely to be substantial variation from year to year,
	due to changing conditions and other random-seeming forces

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamics

	We expect to see smooth behaviour in many cases

	Cycles and complex behaviour should arise for reasons similar to our
	unstructured models: 

		Delays in the system

		Strong population response to density

	Age distribution will be determined by:

		$\ell_x$, and

		whether the population has been growing or declining recently
