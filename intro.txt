Expectations of professor

	Start and end on time

	Focus on conceptual understanding

	Make clear what terminology and facts must be learned

	Open to questions -- both in class (within reason) and at office
	hours

	Responsive to questions on class forums (Facebook and AtL)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Expectations of students

	Start and end on time

	Don't talk while other students are talking, or while I am
	responding to student questions

	If you must talk at other times, be unobtrusive

	Don't use the internet for non-class activities

	Attend the lecture, and the mandatory tutorials

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Texts

	The primary text for this course is the lecture notes

	You will be given readings, which will be posted to AtL

	You are required to have an Ecology textbook

		Molles and Cahill, Second Canadian edition is recommended

		If you would like to use a different textbook, let your TA know, so we
		can attempt to provide readings.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Structure of presentation

	Required material will be clearly outlined in the notes

		ANS This is an answer: it was omitted from the notes for
		discussion purposes, you should probably write it in

		COMMENT This is a comment: I omitted from the notes because I
		thought it wasn't necessary for you to study.  If you write it
		in, make a note to yourself that it's a comment.

	Required terminology will be presented in {\bf bold}

	General ideas and approaches presented in class may also be required;
	you should take notes on these in your own words

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Taking notes

	You will do best if you take notes

		You should know by now what works for you
		
		Or else that you need to keep working on it

	If a new concept is making sense to you right now, write something
	that will help you remember

	If there's something specific I think you all need to write down, I will
	write it for you (or mark it as an answer)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Polling

	You can obtain extra credit by responding to in-class polls

		Text from your cell phone, or answer on the web

	POLL multiple_choice_polls/GIIaWUc3IILowd0 Why are you taking this class? Fits my career plans; Prerequisite for another course; Need a biology elective; Fits my schedule; Interested in ecology; Interested in quantitative biology

	Ecology and population ecology

	Quantitative thinking

	Dynamical modeling

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	POLL free_text_polls/AB9Spl3gAPFr4bZ  What is ecology?

	My answer

		ANS The study of how organisms interact with each other and with
		the environment

		ANS Ecology is not environmentalism 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

	POLL free_text_polls/XzV6zQmcKffjjd7  What is population ecology?

	My answer

		ANS The study of how organisms interact with each other and with
		the environment at the population scale

		ANS Larger spatial scale, longer temporal scale

		ANS We use \emph{dynamical models} to link from the individual level to
		the population level

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamical modeling

BC

	Investigates the links between local, short-term processes, and
	large-scale, long-term outcomes

	Allows us to explore what assumptions we're making, and how
	assumptions affect the link

	Population ecology uses math

		Math is a critical tool for linking processes to outcomes

		Math will play a central role in the course 

	We will keep it {\em simple}

		But we understand that simple does not always mean easy

		10% of eggs hatch into larvae

		10% of larvae mature into pupae

		50% of pupae mature into adults

Moth calculation

	Researchers studying a gypsy moth population make the following
	estimates:

		The average reproductive female lays 600 eggs

			CLASS ANS Assume half are female

		10% of eggs hatch into larvae

		10% of larvae mature into pupae

		50% of pupae mature into adults

		50% of adults survive to reproduce

		All adults die after reproduction

	What happens if we start with 10 moths?

		ANS If 5 are female, we end up with an average of 7.5 moths

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Stochastic version

	Obviously, we will not get \emph{exactly} 7.5 moths.

	If we consider moths as individuals, we need a \textbf{stochastic}
	model

	What do we mean by stochastic?

TSS Bacteria

	Imagine we have some bacteria growing in a big tank, constantly
	dividing and dying:

		They divide (forming two bacteria from one) at a rate
		of $0.04/\hr$

		They wash out of the tank at a rate of 0.02/\hr

		They die at a rate of 0.01/\hr

	Rates are \textbf{per capita} (i.e., per individual) and
	\textbf{instaneous} (they describe what is happening at each moment
	of time)

	We start with 10 bacteria/ml

		How many do we have after 1 hr?

		What about after 1 day?

		They die at a rate of 0.24/day

	If we start with 10 bacteria/ml, how many do we have after 1 day?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Units

	When we attach units to a quantity, the meaning is concrete

		0.24/day \emph{must} mean exactly the same thing as 0.01/hr

		The two questions above \emph{must} have the same answer

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RSLIDE Bacteriostasis

	What if we add an agent to the tank that makes the birth and death
	rates nearly zero?

	Moral:

		Units (km is \emph{not} a speed)

		Exponential decay

	Imagine now that I follow the signs exactly and unrealistically.

	POLL free_text_polls/S26Ff64KtIKSTZF  Do I ever arrive in the (ideal) town of Speed?

		ANS No. I am always an hour away!

		ANS But I do get extremely close (after several hours)

	Does anyone remember Zeno's paradox?

		ANS Don't worry about it, then

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Characteristic times

	If something is declining exponentially, the rate of change
	(units [widgets/time]) is always proportional to the size of the
	thing ([widgets]).

	The constant ratio between the rate of change and the thing that is
	changing is:

		the \textbf{characteristic time} (something/change), or

		the \textbf{rate of exponential decline} (change/something)

		POLL free_text_polls/JRJ9UOOsZ3052bz  1 hr?

		POLL free_text_polls/Vyxs1snuAcpzKCj  1 wk?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bacteriostasis answers

	Bacteria wash out at the rate of 0.02/hr

		ANS This can only make sense with concrete units if we think of
		it as an instantaneous rate -- more soon

		ANS $N = N_0 exp(-rt)$

	Start with 10 bacteria/ml:

		ANS After one hour, 9.802 bacteria/ml

		ANS After one week, 0.347 bacteria/ml

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bacteriostasis analysis

	Rate of exponential decline is $r = 0.02/\hr$

	Characteristic time is $T_c = 1/r = 50 \hr$

	If experiment time $t \ll T_c$, then proportional decline $\approx
	t/T_c$

	The answer makes sense for short times and for long times

Euler's $e$

	The reason mathematicians like $e$ is that it makes this link
	between instantaneous change and long-term behaviour

	If I drive for an hour, how much closer do I get to the ideal town
	of Speed?

		ANS $e$ times closer

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CONT Euler's $e$

	$e$ or $1/e$ is the approximate answer to a lot of questions like this one

		If I compound 1%/year interest for 100 years, how much does my money grow?

		If two people go deal out two decks of cards simultaneously, what is the
		probability they will never match cards?

		If everyone picks up a backpack at random after a test, what's the probability nobody gets the right backpack? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exponential growth

	We can think about exponential growth the same way as exponential
	decline:

		Things are always changing at a rate that would take a fixed
		amount of time to get (back) to zero

		This is the characteristic time

		Exponential growth follows $N = N_0 \exp(rt) = N_0\exp(t/T_c)$

Doubling time

	Some people prefer to think about doubling times.

	These make just as much sense as characteristic times, but don't
	have the direct link to the instantaneous change.

		It takes $T_c$ time to increase by a factor of $e$

		It takes $\log_e(2) T_c \approx 0.69 T_c$ to increase by a factor
		of 2

		We can write $T_d = \log_e(2) T_c$

	You should be able to do this calculation

		NOTES $\exp(rT_d) = 2$

		NOTES $T_d = \log_e(2)/r$

		NOTES $T_d = \log_e(2) T_c$

Half life

	The half life plays the same role for exponential decline as the
	doubling time does for exponential growth:

		$T_h = \log_e(2) T_c$

		It takes $T_c$ time for a declining population to decrease by a
		factor of $e$

		It takes $\log_e(2) T_c \approx 0.69 T_c$ to decrease by a factor
		of 2

		We can write $T_h = \log_e(2) T_c$
