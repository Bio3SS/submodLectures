SEC Introduction

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inter-species interactions

	Competition: interaction hurts the growth rate of both species

		NOANS

	Exploitation: interaction is good for one species but bad for the
	other

		NOANS

	Mutualism: interaction is good for both species

		NOANS

	Commensalism: interaction is good for one species, and close to
	neutral for the other

		NOANS

CHANGE Make sure you ask for examples. How should NOANS show up in complete notes?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition

	Competition occurs when two species both depend on the same
	resource, or resources

	Each species ability to reproduce successfully is reduced by the
	presence of the other 
	
	CHANGE ML : (components of successful reproduction)

		ANS Survival, growth, producing offspring

	Species may be very similar, or very different

		ANS Oaks and maples competing for light

		ANS Ants and mammals competing for leaves

		ANS Mussels and algae competing for space in the intertidal zone

Competition in ecology

	What factors determine which species survive in which habitats?

	What factors determine how many similar species can co-exist?

	Why do similar species coexist at all?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Flour beetles

	There is a series of experiments where researchers allow two
	species of flour beetles to compete in different laboratory
	environments 

	The larger species survives better in drier conditions, and the
	smaller species reproduces faster in moister conditions

	POLL free_text_polls/0b9fhjVf23qirZU What outcomes do you expect under wet vs dry conditions?

		ANS Each species wins when conditions are better for it

	POLL free_text_polls/qH625W9P4YsheuW What if I ``tune" the conditions to something in between? What if I tune the conditions to something in between?

		ANS The species could both survive together

		ANS Sometimes one survives, and sometimes the other

			ANS Whichever species got a ``head start'' would survive

----------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMENT The confused flour beetle

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Outcomes of competition

	In a given stable environment, we generally expect the competitive
	interaction between two species to have one of the following results

		{\bf Dominance}: one species wins every time

		{\bf Co-existence}: if both species are present, they will both
		persist

		{\bf Founder control}: whichever species gets established first
		will exclude the other


----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Population model with competition

	We modeled a single species using the equation:

		$\ds \frac{dN}{dt} = (b(N)-d(N)) N$

	We want to modify this for a species which is competing
	with another species

		$\ds \frac{dN_1}{dt} = ? $

	The amount of competition seen by species 1 is $\tilde N_1 = N_1 +
	\alpha_{21} N_2$

	How should our equation change?

		ANS $\ds \frac{dN_1}{dt} = (b_1(\tilde N_1) - d_1(\tilde N_1))
		N_1 $

		ANS $\ds \frac{dN_2}{dt} = (b_2(\tilde N_2) - d_2(\tilde N_2))
		N_2 $

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Carrying capacity

	For this unit, we will mostly ignore Allee effects

	Therefore, we expect each species to converge to its \emph{carrying
	capacity} $K$ (or $K_1$ and $K_2$) when it is alone

	How do we define carrying capacity in this system?

		ANS The birth rate equals the death rate: $b(K) = d(K)$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Carrying capacity with competition

	$\ds \frac{dN_1}{dt} = (b_1(\tilde N_1) - d_1(\tilde N_1))
	N_1 $

	How can this population be at equilibrium?

		ANS $\tilde N_1 = K_1$:  the species has the right amount of
		competitive pressure to make $\R=1$

		ANS $N_1 = 0$: the species is not present

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Logistic model

	You've probably learned about the logistic model, if not you may
	learn about it later

	This model is similar to the logistic model, except:

		Birth and death are tracked separately

		We don't assume functions are straight lines

	Everything we say about this model also applies to the logistic model

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SS Balanced competition

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Equal competition

	If the $\alpha$s are both equal to one, we have equal competition.
	This means that the competitive effect of an individual from either
	species is the same.

	If $\bar N = N_1 + N_2$, then:

		$\ds \frac{dN_1}{dt} = (b_1(\bar N) - d_1(\bar N)) N_1 $

		$\ds \frac{dN_2}{dt} = (b_2(\bar N) - d_2(\bar N)) N_2 $

	What happens in this case?

		ANS Competition is mediated by only one quantity, $\bar N$.

		ANS Whichever species has a higher value of $K$ can survive at a density
		where the other one can't 
		
		ANS Dominance!

	or \emph{linear} scale

	Log plots show \emph{proportional} differences

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Units of $\alpha$

	$\tilde N_1 = N_1 + \alpha_{21} N_2$;
	$\tilde N_2 = N_2 + \alpha_{12} N_1$

	$\alpha_{21}$ measures the strength of the competitive effect
	\emph{of} individuals of species 2 \emph{on} the growth rate
	of species 1.  
	
	What are the units of $\alpha_{21}$?

		ANS $\indiv_1/\indiv_2$

	Since $\alpha$ has units, we don't expect there to be anything
	special about $\alpha=1$

	Equal competition (both species have the same effect on each other)
	is a special case of balanced competition (both species have the
	same \emph{relative} effect on each other)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Balanced competition example

	Two plants compete with each other for water.  The value of
	$\alpha_{21}$ is $4 \indiv_1/\indiv_2$

	POLL free_text_polls/g5R5Ndmc1sWEW0y Which species is bigger?

		ANS Species 2 individuals use as much water as 4
		species 1 individuals

	If they're only competing for water, what's the value of
	$\alpha_{12}$?

		ANS $\alpha_{12} = 1\indiv_2/4\indiv_1$

		ANS In some sense this means the same thing: the larger plant
		has four times as much impact as the smaller one

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RSLIDE Balanced competition example

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Balanced competition

	POLL free_text_polls/mzmM5jlhNAR7acn What results do we expect from balanced competition?

		ANS It seems like the bigger species should win

		ANS But that's not always the case

	Balanced competition works just like equal competition

		ANS Both species experience total density in the same way

		ANS So the species with the higher carrying capacity (compared
		using the same units) will dominate

	Balanced competition means (exactly) no tendency for founder
	control or for coexistence

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Measuring competitive effects

	It makes sense that we have a range of parameters that give us
	balanced competition, because we know qualitative changes in
	dynamics are explained by unitless parameters

	What's the unitless parameter here?

		ANS $C = \alpha_{21}\alpha_{12}$

	$C$ measures the relative effect of between-species and
	within-species competition

		$C=1$ means competition is balanced 

		$C<1$ means there is more competition within species (tendency
		for coexistence)

		$C>1$ means there is more competition between species (tendency
		for founder control)

----------------------------------------------------------------------


TSS Unbalanced competition

BC

	If two species are competing by using a simple resource, we expect
	competition to be balanced

		Both $\alpha$s measure the relative effect of the two species on
		the resource

	In more realistic situations, competition may not be balanced

Coexistence

	Coexistence \emph{may} occur when $C<1$

	POLL free_text_polls/lwU5FiTR9eTocwE Why might individuals have relatively weaker competitive interactions with members of the other species?

		ANS They may compete for mates or mating sites

			ANS Example: birds with different nesting preferences

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Results of competition

	$C$ measures the relative effect of each species on each other, but
	it doesn't reflect growth rates or how strongly each species is
	affected by competition

	$C$ may stay (about) the same, even as we switch conditions so that
	one or the other species dominates

	POLL free_text_polls/0TyG26NIKwEG1BY $C$ tells us what will happen \emph{if} neither species is dominating. What are the possible results, other than dominance?

		ANS Founder effects, neutrality or coexistence

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Population-level interactions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Invasion theory

	The competitive relationship between two species can be
	investigated by studying two \textbf{invasion} scenarios:

	What happens if one species is established, and the other one tries
	to invade (ie., some individuals are introduced)?

		ANS Dominance occurs when one species can invade the other

		ANS Coexistence occurs when each species can invade the other

		ANS Founder control occurs when neither species can invade the
		other

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Allee effects

	This analysis assumes that species that can be successful under a
	certain competitive environment can also invade that environment

	That is, it neglects Allee effects

	Would this assumption work with Allee effects?

		ANS No. With Allee effects a species may be able to do well if established, but not be able to ``invade" if it's rare

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive results

	The competitive effect felt by species 1 is measured by $\tilde
	N_1$ 

	The \emph{amount} of competition needed for species 1 to be at
	equilibrium is:

		ANS $\tilde N_1 = K_1$

	The amount of competition species 1 feels when trying to invade a
	population of species 2 is:

		ANS $\tilde N_1 = \alpha_{21} N_2$

		ANS = $\alpha_{21} K_2$, if species 2 is at equilibrium

	If species 1 feels more competition from invading species two than
	it feels at its own equilibrium, it cannot invade.   And
	\textbf{conversely}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Population-level competitive effects

	The population-level competitive effect of species 2 on species one
	is $E_{21} \equiv \alpha_{21} K_2/K_1$

	This is the unitless ratio of the two measures of effect on
	species 1 from the previous slide.

	The two values of $E$ determine the competitive dynamics between
	the two species.

	If $E_{21} > 1$ species 2 can exclude species 1 (species 1 cannot
	invade).  And \textbf{conversely}.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Results of competition

	If both $E$s are $<1$, neither can exclude the other

		ANS We expect coexistence

	If both $E$s are $>1$, they both exclude each other
	
		ANS which species wins will depend on starting conditions:
		founder control

	If one $E$ is $>1$, the large-$E$ species can exclude the other

		ANS We expect that species to always win: dominance

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Measuring competition

	$\alpha$ measures competitive effects at the individual level
	
		has units (ratios of types of individuals)

	$E$ measures competitive effects at the population level, using
	equilibrium populations

		unitless

	$C = \alpha_{21}\alpha_{12} = E_{21} E_{12}$ 

		$C$ tells us: do the species have a \emph{tendency} for founder
		control or coexistence?

	For specific conditions, we would need to also know values of $E$

		Each species may dominate when conditions are good for it

		We see the tendency for founder control or coexistence in
		intermediate conditions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Neutral competition

	If competition is balanced, and neither species dominates, this is
	called neutral competition

	No tendency for either species to win

	No tendency for founder control or for coexistence

	If there's any small difference between the species, one may
	dominate

	Even if there's no difference, one should win eventually, by random
	``drift"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Founder control 

	Up until now, we've thought of founder control as a single outcome

	But from the point of view of the competing species, it's pretty
	important which one of them gets control

	POLL free_text_polls/gHep7iMXNN0oI1Q What factors determine who gets control?

		ANS Who gets there first

		ANS Initial maximum growth rate

		ANS How strongly they affect each other

TSS Colonization and co-existence

	Up until now, we've thought about the question of which species
	controls a particular area in the long term

	But if available habitat is changing, it also matters what happens
	in the short term

	$rK$ tradeoff

		$r$ strategists do better in the short term; $K$ strategists do
		better do better in the long term
	
	POLL free_text_polls/kPxgrXkNfkdj7sU When can you survive by doing better in the short term?

		ANS When new opportunities (empty habitat) keep coming available

			ANS When there is a lot of disturbance: fire, flood \ldots

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth rates

	The maximum growth rate (for each species) is $r_0 = (b(0) - d(0))$:

		ANS The net growth rate when crowding pressure is very low

	The species with the better $r_0$ should do better in the short run

		Faster exponential growth

	If patches are very stable, then $K$ species wins

	If they are very unstable, then $r$ species wins

	In between, we get coexistence at the level of multiple populations

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fundamental niches

	A {\bf fundamental} niche is defined as the conditions under which an
	organism could make a living (in other words, survive with $\R>1$)
	{\em in the absence of competition}.

	Many plants have very large fundamental niches

		The reason spruce trees don't grow in Cootes Paradise is not that
		they can't grow there

		grow there

Example: chipmunks

	There are several species of chipmunks in the Sierra Nevada mountains

		The most aggressive can only survive where the rainfall is good,
		and it out-competes all the other species

		The least aggressive can survive anywhere in the mountain range,
		but it cannot co-exist with any of the other species

	What are the fundamental and realized niches of these species?

		ANS The aggressive species has the same fundamental and realized
		niches: the places where rainfall is good

		ANS The mild-mannered species has a large fundamental niche, but
		its realized niche is the area that's too dry for the other
		species

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS The competitive exclusion principle

	If two species use resources in the same way, we expect that
	$C=1$.

		The effect of an individual of each species can be measured by
		its impact on resources.  If individuals of species one have
		(e.g.) twice the impact, this should be seen by both species
		equally.

	If two species use resources in the same way, we do not expect them
	to co-exist

		One species will use the resources more efficiently (nothing in
		biology is exactly equal)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exclusion and drift

	Even if the two species were \emph{exactly} equal
	in efficiency, we expect one species to go extinct at random

	Due to the randomness of births and deaths, we expect the
	proportions to fluctuate at random until one proportion reaches 0
	and gets stuck there

		We call this process ``drift", and it is strongly analogous to
		genetic drift

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive exclusion and biodiversity

	Two species that use resources the same way cannot co-exist in a
	stable environment in the long term due to their competitive
	dynamics

	This statement can be justified mathematically, and it has
	important implications for real populations \ldots\
	
	\ldots but it must also break down 

	POLL XXX How? Why do we observe species co-existing?

		ANS Species may not use resources in the same way

		ANS The environment may not be stable

		ANS Co-existence may not be ``long term"!

		ANS There may be stabilizing factors outside competitive dynamics
		(e.g., natural enemies)
