UNIT 5: Life history

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Introduction

	{\bf Life history} refers to patterns of how organisms allocate
	resources to key components underlying reproductive success:

	POLL  Give a one-word example of such a component. 

		ANS Survival

		ANS Growth

		ANS Reproduction

		ANS Dispersal

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Diversity

	Differing life-history \textbf{strategies} are part of the reason
	for the remarkable diversity of life

		Organisms that are too similar are not expected to co-exist

			One will out-compete the other

		But two organisms may be able to exploit the same resources using
		different life-history strategies

Oaks and dandelions

	We can think of acorns as machines for making more acorns, and
	dandelion seeds as machines for making more dandelion seeds

	Both have access to very similar biochemical machinery.
	Both use the same resources.

		ANS Water, sunlight, nutrients

	POLL  What are some differences?

		ANS Oak trees are bigger

		ANS Oak trees wait longer to reproduce

		ANS Oak trees reproduce many times
		
		ANS Oak trees put much more energy into each seed

		ANS Dandelion seeds are dispersed by wind, acorns by animals

Scales of competition

	Organisms compete with other individuals of the same species

	They also compete with other species

	We think about life history on different scales

		Evolution within populations

		Competition between populations

TSEC Tradeoffs

	Some evolutionary changes simply help organisms function better

		Hemoglobin is highly evolved to bind and release oxygen

	Most have advantages and disadvantages

		Building a strong immune system may reduce growth rates

		A leaf that produces a lot of energy at high light may not be
		able to produce any at low light

	A \textbf{tradeoff} occurs when improvements in one area come at a
	cost of disadvantages in another area

		organisms are under natural selection in a complex world

Optimization frontiers

BC

	Under natural selection, we expect organisms to be near the frontier
	of high fitness 

	While they're near this frontier, it will be hard to improve one
	quality without a tradeoff that hurts another quality

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Evolution and optimization

	We often think of organisms as making ``choices" that maximize their
	evolutionary fitness.

	Do oaks choose how big their acorns should be?

	Then what's going on?

		ANS Natural selection is selecting random variants

		ANS On average, variants which survive are better at producing
		offspring over the long-term than those which don't survive

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Programmed optimization

	Organisms pursue very sophisticated strategies to optimize fitness

	But they don't know they're doing this

		Plants sensing water environments

		Moths circling light bulbs

		People pursuing sexual opportunities

Tradeoff: Quick maturation vs.~large final size

	A key component of a life history is how quickly an organism matures

	Organisms that mature quickly can reproduce quickly

	Organisms that mature slowly have more time to get large, or build
	lasting structures, before they reproduce
	
		they typically reproduce more (or for a longer time period) in
		the long run

		or allocate more energy to each offspring, giving the offspring a
		better chance to be successful

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Tradeoff: large reproductive output vs.~longevity

	Survival-reproduction balance: at a given time, organisms face a
	tradeoff between:

		energy spent on producing offspring 

			produce more offspring, or give more resources to helping
			each get started in life 

		energy reserved for survival and future offspring

			spend less energy reproducing this year, but live for longer

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Semelparity

	The extreme case of this balance is called {\bf semelparity}: the
	life-history strategy of reproducing only once

	Many organisms are semelparous

		We can imagine that converting all your resources to reproduction
		once you start could be very efficient

	Many organisms are {\bf iteroparous}: they reproduce many times

RSLIDE Cole's paradox

FIG webpix/tomato.jpg

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Cole's paradox

BC

	Why are many organisms iteroparous?

	If $\lambda = f + p$, surely it is easier to increase $f$ by
	spending on reproduction, than to increase $p$, which can never be
	larger than 1.

	Raising $p$ from 0 to 1 becoming \emph{immortal} instead of annual,
	is only as good as increasing $f$ by 1

NC

SIDEFIG webpix/tomato.jpg

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Responses to Cole

	What are some reasons why it makes evolutionary sense for organisms
	to be iteroparous, in light of Cole's arguments?

		ANS ``Closing the loop": $f$ is not seeds per plant, it's
		plants per plant; not as high as you think

		ANS Population regulation: the long-term average value of
		$\lambda$ is 1, so increasing $f$ by 1 is a \emph{lot}

		ANS Risky environments: long-lived organisms can deal better with
		variation in offspring success. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RSLIDE Responses to Cole

Tradeoff example: many offspring vs.~high-quality offspring

	Apart from how much energy to put into offspring now vs.~later,
	organisms can make many or few offspring, using a given amount of
	energy

	What is a vivid example of ecologically similar organisms that
	produce wildly different numbers of offspring?

		ANS Oaks vs.~pines

		ANS Tsetses vs. mosquitoes

	POLL  What are potential advantages of producing fewer offspring with the same amount of energy?

		ANS Greater chance of survival (or reproductive success)

		ANS Dispersal

		ANS More energy left over?

			ANS No (see question)

Tradeoff: direct investment vs.~dispersal investment

	Investment in reproduction may not go directly to the
	offspring, but instead to mechanisms to help the offspring disperse.
	
	Why is this particularly important in plants?

	What are some example mechanisms?

TSEC The $r$ vs.~$K$ metaphor

	Regulated growth provides a powerful metaphor for life-history
	tradeoffs involving growth vs. competitive ability

	Recall $r$ and $K$ from our regulated population models.
		
		ANS $r$ is the per-capita rate of growth, units ...

			ANS [1/t]

		ANS $K$ is the stable, equilibrium level that we expect a
		population to reach, units ...

			ANS [pop] or [pop density]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFHEAD $r$ vs.\ $K$ strategies

	We call organisms that tend to out-perform other species at low
	densities ``$r$-strategists''

		They do well in recently disturbed, uncrowded environments 

	We call organisms that tend to out-perform other species at high
	densities ``$K$-strategists''

		They do well in stable, crowded environments

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFHEAD $r$-strategists

	All organisms tend to do well in uncrowded environments, but
	$r$-strategists are selected to do better than other species

	They are selected for a high rate of exponential growth during the
	relatively short time that the environment is uncrowded

	Why do we call them $r$-strategists, and not $\R$-strategists?

		ANS Because they are selected to maximize $\rmax$, the
		\emph{rate} of exponential growth

		ANS A species with a high value of $\Rmax$, but a slow life
		cycle, may not have enough time to capitalize on the opportunity

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFHEAD $K$-strategists

	$K$-strategists are selected to do well in crowded environments

	$K$ measures the maximum density at which a species can ``make a
	living'' -- by keeping $\R=1$

	Comparing $K$ between species can be tricky

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RSLIDE Maples and marigolds

Measuring $K$

	Which is the $K$ strategist: maple trees or marigolds?

		ANS Maple trees do better at competing under stable conditions

		ANS Marigolds are faster at invading new environments

	Which has a higher value of $\rmax$?

		ANS Marigolds

	Which has a higher value of $K$?

		POLL  In [indiv/ha]? Which has a higher carrying capacity [indiv/ha]? maples; marigolds

		POLL  In [kg/ha]? Which has a higher carrying capacity [kg/ha]? maples; marigolds

	To compare species, we attempt to measure $K$ in units that reflect
	the effect of crowding on the competitive environment

		biomass; area covered; resource consumed

RSLIDE Stable environment

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: trees

	Assuming there is a tradeoff between $\rmax$ and $K$, would you
	expect individuals with high $\rmax$, or high $K$, to do well:

		In an empty, suitable habitat after a fire, flood, clearcut or other
		major {\bf disturbance}?

			ANS High $\rmax$ leads to faster exponential growth

		In a crowded, stable old-growth forest?

			ANS High $K$ means you can continue doing well when the forest
			is already too crowded for others

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DEFHEAD $r$ vs.~$K$ strategists

	All species are selected for characteristics relating to both $\rmax$
	and $K$

	But it is often useful to compare species based on which they
	emphasize more heavily

		There will often be tradeoffs between $\rmax$ and $K$

	Species that specialize in colonizing disturbed environments are
	thought of as $r$ strategists 

		Apple trees are often the first to reproduce in abandoned
		fields

	Species that specialize in stable environments are thought of as
	$K$ strategists

		Hemlock trees do best in stable, closed forests

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Life-history characteristics

	Compared to $K$ strategists, $r$ strategists should:

		Have relatively fast life cycles

			Reach maturity earlier

			Allocate more resources to reproduction (and thus reproduce
			more and survive less)

		Produce more offspring, with less resources for each

			This allows high growth rates in the absence of competition

			In crowded conditions, these ``quick" offspring may
			be out-competed by offspring with more resources

		Be more aggressive about dispersal. 

			ANS They need to find the next empty, suitable habitat before
			this one gets too crowded

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Biology is complicated

	The $r$-$K$ dichotomy is useful for thinking about strategies, but
	organisms don't always fit it perfectly

	Some species live long, but don't invest a lot in each offspring

		Sea turtles, pine trees

	Some species mature slowly but reproduce only once

		17-year cicadas, century plants

	Every species life history has specific, important {\em details}

		But general principles are very important to guide our
		understanding

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changing conditions

	Recall, $\lambda$ is usually between 1 and $\R$, gets closer to 1
	when the life cycle is 

		ANS slower

	When conditions are good ($\R>1$), should organisms be fast
	or slow to maximize $\lambda$?

		ANS Fast

	POLL  When conditions are bad ($\R<1$),
	should organisms be fast or slow to maximize $\lambda$?  Should organisms be fast or slow to maximize λ under bad conditions? fast; slow; it depends

		ANS Slow!

		ANS Decrease more slowly during the bad times

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changing life history

	Some organisms have evolved to change their life history patterns in
	response to good or bad conditions

		ANS Move slow when things are bad, and fast when things are good

	POLL  What are some examples? Can you think of an example of changing life-history patterns?

		ANS Many animals reach sexual maturity faster under good
		conditions: horses, elephants

		ANS Trees may survive longer under bad conditions (by growing
		slowly and not allocating energy to reproduction)

		ANS Bacteria enter ``stationary state'' when conditions are
		bad -- don't reproduce or grow at all, but may survive for a long
		time

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Applications

	How would $r$ and $K$ strategists differ in their response to human
	activities/disturbance?

		ANS $r$ strategists will generally deal with disturbance better

	What are advantages of $r$ or $K$ strategists for human production (eg.
	biofuels, agriculture, drug production etc..)?

	POLL  What are some advantages of $r$ strategists?
	What are some advantages of r strategists?

		ANS grow faster

		ANS likely to respond well to disturbance

	POLL  What are some advantages of $K$ strategists?
	What are some advantages of K strategists?

		ANS may be more sustainable to grow for a long
		time in a stable environment

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Bet hedging

	In a risky world, you never want to put all your eggs in the same
	basket

		If all your offspring are born into similar conditions, they can all do
		well together -- or they can all die together

	Strategies that \emph{usually} do well aren't good enough

		The species we see now have survived for billions of years (if we
		include ancestral species, who also had to survive)

			Floods, fires, ice ages, disease outbreaks

	All ``successful" organisms have strategies for spreading risk

		ANS By successful organism, I mean surviving organism

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Averaging

	Mathematically, we can think about bet-hedging strategies in terms
	of averages

	Arithmetic means are means with respect to addition:

		$x + y + z = m + m + m$

	Geometric means are means with respect to multiplication:

		$x * y * z = m * m * m$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Averaging

	A population has a different growth rate ($\lambda$) each year. The
	long term growth rate would be the same if it grew by what constant
	amount each year?

		ANS The geometric mean growth rate

	A farmer harvests dandelion seeds from 5 different fields. Each
	field produces a different number of seeds. The harvest would be the
	same if each field produced what constant amount?

		ANS The arithmetic mean seed production

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: plant Q

	Plant Q is an annual plant.  
	
	Each successful adult produces 30 offspring on average
	
	In a good year, 20% of these offspring survive to reproduce; in a
	normal year 2% of the offspring survive to reproduce; in a bad year
	0.2% of the offspring survive to reproduce

	The three kinds of year are equally likely
	
	POLL  What is the long term average growth rate of plant Q?

		ANS The geometric mean of 6, 0.6 and 0.06: $\lambda=0.6$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Plant D

	Plant D is similar to plant Q, except that it produces seeds that
	disperse over great distances

	Because it has to invest in dispersal mechanisms, it only produces
	half as many seeds.

	The seeds of the new variety do just as well as those of plant Q,
	but they disperse so far (in this hypothetical example) that 1/3 of
	them experience good, normal and bad conditions every year.

	POLL  What is the average growth rate of plant D?

		ANS Average survival is the mean of 0.2, 0.02, and 0.002

		ANS Growth is the arithmetic mean of 3, 0.3 and 0.03: $\lambda=1.11$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Averaging

	Variation between organism generations is multiplicative; we
	understand its effect using the geometric mean

		ANS Because we multiply per-capita success in each generation to
		find out what happens to the population

	Variation within a generation is additive; we understand its effect
	using the arithmetic mean

		ANS Because lifetime reproductive success is calculated by adding
		components from different places or time periods

	The arithmetic mean is greater than the geometric mean.  When
	variation is high, it can be much greater

		Therefore, organisms benefit from averaging within generations,
		rather than between generations

Dispersal, spreading risk over space

	As an organism, do I want my offspring to grow up where I grew up,
	or to disperse?

	Advantages of staying home

		ANS Dispersal is costly

		ANS Home is apparently a good place to survive 
		
			ANS the parent survived and is reproducing

		ANS Support from kin group

	Advantages of dispersal

		ANS Reduce competition between offspring

		ANS Distribute risk -- if you don't disperse, \emph{all}
		of your offspring could die if there is a disturbance

		ANS Reduce inbreeding

		ANS May find a better place

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Spreading risk over time

	Organisms that disperse spread their risk across space

	But some disturbances (bad weather, disease outbreaks) may cover
	very large areas

	Many organisms also have mechanisms for spreading risk over time

		Iteroparity

		Delayed development: many semelparous organisms have mechanisms
		that allow a fraction of their offspring to remain {\bf dormant}
		(ie., wait) before developing

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why is it called bet hedging?

	Bet hedging means reducing your risk, or not betting everything you
	have on any one choice, even if it's a good choice.

		ANS If you don't disperse in space, or spread out risk in time,
		you are ``betting" all of your offspring on a single environment

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSEC Sex ratios

	POLL  To maximize fitness, should organisms allocate more resources to producing males or females? | Organisms can maximize fitness by allocating:
	equally; more to males; more to females

		ANS They should allocate more resources to females because it is
		females that limit the growth rate

		ANS They should allocate the same amount of resources to males
		and females because males and females contribute the same amount
		of fitness to the next generation

		ANS They should allocate more resources to males, because males
		have greater potential reproductive success

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The balance argument

	In a sexual population, half of all the alleles in each generation
	come from males, and half from females

	Therefore, the total fitness of males and the total fitness of
	females in the population is equal

	Therefore, individuals should allocate resources equally to
	offspring of each type

		ANS If the population on average is allocating more to one type,
		individuals who allocate more to the other type would do better
		than average

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: elephant seals

BC

	Male elephant seals can control large territories and mate with very
	large numbers of females

	Females produce at most 12 offspring over the course of their lives

		And do all of the work of raising them

	To maximize their fitness, should female elephant seals produce more
	male offspring, or more female offspring?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Elephant seal details

	Imagine a population where 90% of elephant seals born are males.  
	A certain ``generation" of 400 elephant seals produces 600 successful
	offspring (counting in a reasonable, closed-loop way).

	What is the average fitness of the males and the females in this
	generation?

		ANS Half of the genes, and half of the fitness comes from 360
		males; half from 40 females

		ANS Males' average fitness is 300/360=0.83; females' is 300/40 =
		7.5

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sex ratio and balance

	Imagine a population where organisms use the same amount of
	resources to produce male or female offspring

	Thus, the \emph{number} of offspring I can make does not depend on
	sex

	POLL  If everyone else is making more males than females, what should I
	do? | If everyone else is making more males than females I should allocate:  equally; more to males; more to females

		ANS Make more females, because that will increase my average
		fitness

	POLL How will this population evolve in the long term?

		ANS More and more females

		ANS Eventually, a balanced sex ratio

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Allocation and balance

	The balance argument is based on the idea that organisms have
	resources that they control and use for growth and reproduction

	What if organisms invest more resources in producing one
	sex than the other?

		What balances is the amount of \emph{resources} spent on each
		sex

	Example: what if elephant seal mothers invest twice as much per
	males as per female, so their male offspring can compete?

		ANS This means they can ``choose" to produce one male, or
		two females

		ANS Thus, the population will balance when male fitness is twice
		as high as female fitness

		ANS This happens when there are twice as many females as males --
		the \emph{investment} in the two sexes is the same.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: Fig wasps

BC

	Many species of fig wasps have sex inside figs

		Most sex is between brothers and sisters

		POLL What offspring ratio would maximize the mother's fitness in this
		case?

			ANS Have mostly female offspring

NC

SIDEFIG webpix/fig_wasp_dimorphism.png

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fig wasp details

	Why does the balance argument not work in this case?

	Males have higher mean fitness than females in this population

	Would a mother benefit by producing more males than others do?

		ANS No, because these males would not have access to the extra
		females produced by other mothers

		ANS Producing males because \emph{average} male fitness is
		higher works only if your males can \emph{share} that average
		fitness

		ANS In this case, if I produce more males, they would probably compete
		only with their brothers

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Female-biased sex ratios

	In most organisms (not all) females contribute more direct resources
	to producing offspring than males

	Such organisms should invest more in females than in males whenever
	sex with kin is likely

		The kin group produces more offspring overall

	If organisms invest more per individual male, this could also bias
	the sex ratio in the same direction

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Variation in reproductive success

	You should recall that in many animals males have very large
	variation in reproductive success

	Variation in reproductive success does not affect the balance
	argument:

		We expect equal total resources to be used for females and males

	Instead it affects allocation per individual

		ANS Giving male offspring more resources has greater benefits
		than for female offspring 

		ANS Organisms should use more resources per male, and thus
		produce fewer male offspring

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sexual roles

	What do you expect to happen in a population where males contributing more to raising offspring than females do?

	CHANGE typo contributing

		ANS All of these stories can be reversed

			ANS Females compete for males

			ANS Parents invest more in individual females

			ANS Possible male-biased sex ratio

	Can you think of any examples?

Equids

	Horses and zebras have harem males who compete for access to females

	Successful stallions can have very high fitness

	Females produce offspring at similar rates through their
	adult lives

	Healthy, middle-aged mares produce a greater fraction of males

		Presumably they are allocating more resources to these males
		(because they have more resources available)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CONT Equids

	It is not clear from studies whether they produce fewer males than
	females over their lifespan to compensate (balance would predict
	that they should)

	These animals \emph{do} show female-biased sex ratios of adults

	What is another possible, related reason?

		ANS Males pursue high-risk development strategies, and therefore
		have lower survival

		being dominant and reproductively successful
