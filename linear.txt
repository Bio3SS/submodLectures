----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamical models

	\textbf{Dynamical models} describe rules for how a system changes at
	each point in time

	We will see what these assumptions about how the system
	\emph{changes} lead to conclusions about what the system \emph{does}
	over longer time periods

----------------------------------------------------------------------

States and state variables

	Our dynamic models imagine that a system has a \textbf{state} at any
	given time, described by one or more \textbf{state variables}

	These are the things that follow our rules and change

	Examples:

		Dandelions: state is population size, described by one state
		variable (the number of individuals)

		Bacteria: state is population density, described by one state
		variable (the number of individuals per ml)

		Pine trees: state is amount of wood, described by one state
		variable (tons per hectare)

	Limiting the number of state variables is key to simple models

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Parameters

	\textbf{Parameters} are the quantities that describe how the rules for
	our system

	Examples:

		Birth rate, death rate, fecundity, survival probability

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How do populations change?

	I survey a population in 2009, and again in 2013.  I get a different
	answer the second time.

	NEWPOLL  What are some reasons why this answer might change?

		ANS Birth

		ANS Death

		ANS Immigration and emigration

		ANS Sampling (ie., my counts are not perfectly correct)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Censusing and intermediate variables

	Often, our population models will imagine that the population is
	\textbf{censused} (counted) at particular periods of time

	Calculations of what happens between census times may be part of how
	we make our population model, without showing up in the main model
	itself

		For example, our moth and dandelion examples

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Linear population models

	We will focus mostly on births and deaths

	Births and deaths are done by individuals

		We model the rate of each individual (per capita rates)

		Total rate is the per capita rate multiplied by population size

	If per capita rates are constant, we say that our population
	\emph{models} are \textbf{linear}

		Linear models do not usually correspond to linear growth!

		ANS They usually correspond to exponential growth

			ANS \ldots or exponential decline

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions

	If we have $N$ individuals after $T$ time steps, what determines how
	many individuals we have after $T+1$ time steps?

		A fixed proportion $p$ of the population (on
		average) survives to be counted at time step $T+1$

		Each individual creates (on average) $f$ new individuals
		that will be counted at time step $T+1$

	How many individuals do we expect in the next time step?

		ANS $N_{T+1} = (pN_T+fN_T) = (p+f)N_T$

	Diagram

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CONT Assumptions

BC

	Individuals are \textbf{independent}: what I do does not depend on
	how many other individuals are around

	The population is censused at regular time intervals $\Delta
	t$

		Usually $\Delta t$ = 1\yr

	All individuals are the same at the time of census

	Population changes deterministically

		($\Delta t$ has units of time)

		$t_T = T \Delta t$

Interpretation

	Assumptions are simplifications based on reality

	We can understand why populations change exponentially sometimes

	We can look for \emph{reasons} when they don't

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples

BC

	Moths

		$p=0$, so $\lambda=f$. 

			Moths are \textbf{semelparous} (reproduce once); they have
			an \textbf{annual} population

	Dandelions

		If $p>0$, then the dandelions are \textbf{iteroparous}; they are
		a \textbf{perennial} population

SS A simple continuous-time model

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Assumptions

	If we have $N$ individuals at time $t$, how does the population
	change?

		Individuals are giving birth at per-capita rate $b$

		Individuals are dying at per-capita rate $d$

	How we describe the population dynamics?

		ANS $\ds \frac{dN}{dt} = (b-d)N $

		ANS That's what calculus is \emph{for} -- describing
		instantaneous rates of change

----------------------------------------------------------------------

CONT Assumptions

	Individuals are \textbf{independent}: what I do does not depend on
	how many other individuals are around

	The population can be censused at any time

	Population size changes continuously

	All individuals are the same all the time

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Definitions

	$b$ is the \textbf{birth rate}

	$d$ is the \textbf{death rate}

	$r \equiv b-d$ is the {\bf instantaneous rate of increase}.

	These quantities are not associated with a time period, but they
	have units:

		ANS 1/[time]

			ANS $\equiv$ (indiv/[time])/indiv

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Model

	Dynamics: 

		$\ds \frac{dN}{dt} = rN $

	Solution: 

		$N(t) = N_0 \exp(rt)$

	Behaviour

		ANS Increases exponentially when $r>0$

		ANS Decreases exponentially when $r<0$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bacteria

	Conceptually, this is just as simple as the dandelions or the moths

		In fact, simpler

	But we can't do an infinite number of simulation steps on the

Summary

	We can construct simple, conceptual models and make them into
	dynamic models

	If we assume that \emph{individuals} behave independently, then

		we expect \emph{populations} to grow (or decline) exponentially

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Units and scaling

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Units are our friends

BC

	Keep track of units at all times

	Use units to confirm that your answers make sense

		Or to find quick ways of getting the answer

	What is $3\dd \cdot 4 \esp/\dd$?

		ANS $12\esp$

	What is $1\wk \cdot 0.02/\dd$?

		ANS $1\wk \cdot 0.02\dd$

		ANS $1\wk \cdot 0.02\dd \cdot \frac{7\dd}{\wk}$

		ANS 0.14

Manipulating units

BC

	We can {multiply} quantities with different units by keeping track
	of the units

	We \emph{cannot} {add} quantities with different units (unless they
	can be converted to the same units)

	NEWPOLL  How many seconds are there in a day?

		ANS
		$\bigeq \frac{60 \uname{sec}}{\uname{min}} $ 
		$\bigeq  \cdot \frac{60 \uname{min}}{\uname{hr}} $ 
		$\bigeq \cdot \frac{24\uname{hr}}{\uname{day}}$ 

		ANS 86400 \uname{sec}/\uname{day}

Scaling

	Quantities with units set scales, which can be changed

		If I multiply all the quantities with units of time in my model
		by 10, I should get an answer that looks the same, but
		with a different time scale

		If a multiply all the quantities with units of dandelions in my
		model by 10, I should get an answer that looks the same, but with
		a different number of dandelions

Thinking about units 

	NEWPOLL  What is $10^{3 \dd}$? | What is 10 to the power of 3d?

		NOANS

	What is $10^{72\hr}$?

		ANS Nonsense! $72\hr$ means \emph{exactly} the same thing as
		$3\dd$ -- there is no way to resolve this to make sense.

	What is $3\dd \cdot 3\dd$?

		ANS $9\dd^2$ -- this \emph{could} make sense, but it's very
		different from $9\dd$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unit-ed quantities

	Quantities with units \emph{scale}

		If you change everything with the same units by the same factor,
		you should not change the behaviour of your system

	We typically make sense of quantities with units by comparing them
	to other quantities with the same units, e.g.: 

		birth rate vs.\ death rate

		characteristic time of exponential growth vs.\ observation time

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Unitless quantities

	Quantities in exponents must be unitless

	Quantities with variable exponents (quantities that can be
	multiplied by themselves over and over) must be unitless

	Quantities that determine \emph{how} a system behaves must have a
	unitless form

		Otherwise, they could be scaled

		Zero works as a unitless quantity:

			0km = 0cm

	Examples include $\lambda$ and $\R$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

RSLIDE Moth calculation

	Researchers studying a gypsy moth population make the following
	estimates:

		The average reproductive female lays 600 eggs

		10% of eggs hatch into larvae

		10% of larvae mature into pupae

		50% of pupae mature into adults

		50% of adults survive to reproduce

		All adults die after reproduction

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Moths

	$600 \uname{egg}/\uname{rF}$

	$\cdot 0.1 \uname{larva}/\uname{egg}$

	$\cdot 0.1 \uname{pupa}/\uname{larva}$

	$\cdot 0.5 \uname{A}/\uname{pupa}$

	$\cdot 0.5 \uname{rA}/\uname{A}$

	NEWPOLL  What's the product?

		ANS $1.5\uname{rA}/\uname{rF}$

		ANS Need to multiply by something with units rF/rA to close the
		loop

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Closing the loop

	Once we close the loop, it doesn't matter where we start:

		Reproductive adults to reproductive adults

		Larvae to larvae

		Pupae to pupae is common in real studies

			ANS Pupae are easy to count

	If we don't close the loop, we can't correctly move from step to step

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating $\lambda$

	$\lambda \equiv p + f$ is the \textbf{finite rate of increase}

	If $N_{T+1} = \lambda N_T$, what are the units of $\lambda$?

		ANS We multiply by $\lambda$ over and over

		ANS Therefore $\lambda$ must be unitless

	Therefore $p$ and $f$ must be unitless

		example, rA/rA; seed/seed

		to do it right, we close the loop

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEC Key parameters

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Discrete-time model

	$N_{T+1} = \lambda N_T$ 

	$\lambda \equiv p + f$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating fecundity

	Fecundity $f$ in our model must be unitless

	Multiply:

		Probability of surviving from census to reproduction

		Expected number of offspring when reproducing (maternity)

		Probability of offspring surviving to census

	Need to end where we started

	Diagram

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating survival

	Survival $p$ must be unitless

	Multiply:

		Probability of surviving from census to reproduction

		Probability of surviving the reproduction period

		Probability of surviving until the next census

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Finite rate of increase

	Population increases when $\lambda>1$

	So $\lambda$ must be unitless

	But it is \emph{associated with} the time step $\Delta t$

		This means it is potentially confusing. It is often better to
		use $\R$ or $r$ (see below).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Reproductive number 

	The reproductive number \R\ measures the average number of offspring
	produced by a single individual over the course of its lifetime

	NEWPOLL  The population will increase when \R\ldots:| The population will increase when R … .

		ANS $\R>1$

	NEWPOLL  What are the units of \R?  |What are the units of R?

		ANS \R\ must be unitless

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lifespan

	In this model world, how long do individuals live, on average in this model?

	If $p$ is the proportion of individuals that survive, then the
	proportion that die is:

		ANS $\mu = 1-p$

	How many time steps do you expect to survive, on average?  

		ANS $1/\mu$ 

			ANS Roughly makes sense, and is also right

		ANS Average lifetime is $1/\mu * \Delta t$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating \R

	\R\ is fecundity multiplied by lifespan

	$\R = f/\mu = f/(1-p)$

	Why do we multiply by time \emph{steps} instead of lifetime?

		ANS Because $f$ is also measured per time step

		ANS \R\ must be unitless

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison

BCC

\emph{Lifetime reproduction}

	$\R = f/\mu = f/(1-p)$

	Unitless

	Population behaviour depends on the comparison $\R:1$

		Equivalent to $f:\mu$

NCC

\emph{Reproduction over one time step}

	$\lambda = f+p = f+(1-\mu)$

	Unitless

	Population behaviour depends on the comparison $\lambda:1$

		Equivalent to $f:\mu$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Is the population increasing?

	What does $\lambda$ tell us about whether the population is
	increasing?

		ANS Population is increasing each time step when $\lambda>1$

	What does $\R$ tell us about whether the population is increasing?

		ANS Population is increasing when $\R>1$.  Each individual is (on
		average) more than replacing itself over its lifetime

	Therefore, these two criteria must be the same!

		ANS Both come down to $f>\mu$.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------

SS Continuous-time model

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating birth rate

	The birth rate $b$ in the continuous-time model is new individuals
	per individual per unit time

		An instaneous rate

		Units of [1/time] -- implies what assumption?

			ANS New individuals are effectively the same as old individuals

			ANS Not very realistic -- a potential problem with our model world

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating death rate

	The death rate $d$ in the continuous-time model is deaths per
	individual per unit time

		An instaneous rate

		Units of [1/time]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Instaneous rate of increase

	Population increases when $r=b-d > 0$

	$r$ is not unitless, units are:

		ANS [1/time]

	But we still have a unitless criterion: $r=0$

		ANS 0 times anything is really just zero

		ANS Does 0km = 0cm?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculating \R

	The mean lifespan is $L = 1/d$

		Equivalent to the characteristic time for the death process

	\R\ is the average number of births expected over that time frame:

		$\R = bL = b/d$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comparison

BCC

\emph{Lifetime reproduction}

	$\R = bL = b/d$

	Unitless

	Population behaviour depends on the comparison $\R:1$

		Equivalent to $b:d$

NCC

\emph{Instantaneous change}

	$r = b-d $

	Units [1/t] (a rate)

	Population behaviour depends on the comparison $r:0$

		Equivalent to $b:d$

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Is the population increasing?

	What does $r$ tell us about whether the population is
	increasing?

		ANS Population is increasing at any particular time step when
		$r>0$

	What does $\R$ tell us about whether the population is increasing?

		ANS Population is increasing when $\R>1$.  Each individual is (on
		average) more than replacing itself over its lifetime

	Therefore, these two criteria must be the same!

		ANS Both come down to $b>d$.  

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TSS Links

	After one time step in a discrete-time model

		$N_0 \rightarrow N_0 \lambda$

		$t \rightarrow t + \Delta t$

	In a continuous model

		$N_0 \rightarrow N_0 \exp(r\Delta t)$ in the same time period

	To link them, we
	set:

		$\lambda = \exp(r\Delta t)$

	In the other direction:

		ANS $r = \log_e(\lambda)/\Delta t$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Characteristic time

	We can now find characteristic times of exponential change:

		$T_c = 1/r$ for exponential growth when $r>0$

		$T_c = -1/r$ for exponential decline when $r<0$

	Rule of thumb: population changes by a factor of 20 after 3
	characteristic times

Example: Human population growth

	In the last 50,000 years, the population of modern humans has
	increased from about 1000 to about 7 billion

	What value of $r$ does this correspond to?  If we use a time step of
	20-year generations, what value of $\lambda$ does it correspond to?

		ANS $N(t) = N(0) \exp(rt)$

			ANS $r = \log_e(N/N(0))/t$

			ANS $r = \log_e(7000000000/1000)/50000\uname{yr}$ $=
			0.0003/\uname{yr}$

		ANS $N_T = N_0 \lambda^T$

			ANS $T = {t/\Delta t} = 50000\uname{yr}/20\uname{yr} = 2500$

			ANS $\lambda = (N_T/N_0)^{1/T}$

			ANS $\lambda = (7000000000/1000)^{1/2500}$ $= 1.006$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-term growth rate

	What is the long-term average exponential growth rate (using either
	$r$ or $\lambda$) of:

		A successful population?

			ANS Very close to $r=0$ or $\lambda=1$

			ANS But a little larger

		An unsuccessful population?

			ANS \emph{Probably} very close to $r=0$ or $\lambda=1$ 

			ANS But a little smaller

			ANS If much smaller, it would disappear very fast

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Time scales

	Estimated characteristic time scales for exponential growth or decay
	are usually a few (or a few tens) of generations

		years to a few kiloyears

	Species typically persist for far longer

		many kiloyears to megayears

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Balance

	If populations grow and shrink proportionally to their size, why
	don't they go exponentially to zero or infinity?

		ANS \R\ is extremely close to 1 for every species

	How is this possible

		ANS Growth rates change through time

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changing growth rates

	NEWPOLL  What sort of factors can make species growth rates change?

		ANS Seasonality

		ANS Environmental changes (gradual or dramatic)

		ANS Competition within species

		ANS Competition between species

		ANS Predators and diseases

		ANS Resources (food and space)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation

	What do we expect to happen if a population's growth rate is
	affected only by seasons and climate?

		ANS In the long-term, it will grow or shrink according to some
		average value

		ANS We don't expect perfect balance, so we don't expect
		population to stay under control

	What sort of mechanism could keep a population in a reasonable range
	for a long time?

		ANS If the growth rate is directly or indirectly affected by the
		size of the population

		ANS There should be some mechanism that decreases population
		growth rate when population is large

	This is even true for modern humans!
